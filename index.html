            <a id="state of the art" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Uncertainty: Visual Encodings</h3>
        <p>
            Many attempts have been conducted in the literature in order to find the the most proper visual channel to encode
            uncertainty. Although many visual encodings have been tested, transparency seems to be the most effective channel to encode uncertainty.
            An interesting study is reported by Sanyal et al. in [1]. The work reported a user study to compare ed evaluate different approaches.
            In particular they have tested:
            <ul>
                <li>Different Shapes</li>
                <li>Color of the uncertainty glyphs</li>
                <li>Color of the data surface (transparency)</li>
                <li>Errorbars</li>
            </ul>
            From that study came out that error bars underperform withe respect to the others visualization techniques, while
            the others perform in a comparable way. Moreover, a common agreement among visualization researchers is that visualizing
            the uncertainty is highly related with the domain.
        </p>
        <p>
            An interesting study was presented by Brown in [2]. In that study the motion channel was used to encode uncertainty
            of data. Especially, the author focused his attention on using a vibration technique. The main drawback of this technique is the
            perceptual issue. In fact, the vibration could distract the user reducing the effectiveness of the visualization technique.

            <a id="goal" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Goal</h3>
        <p>
            The main goal of these simple visualizations is to visually encode the notion of "uncertainty".
            I have tried different channel like motion, color and shape to encode the uncertainty bound to data.
        </p>
        <h3>

            <a id="data" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Data</h3>
        <p>
            To that goal, I have created a simple dataset. Each data point contains its position in x,y coordinates and a level of uncertainty.
            The idea behind this simple dataset is that the x-coordinate represents a point in time that is certain, while the y-coordinate
            represents the value of a measure to which is associated the uncertainty.
        </p>
        <h3><a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Motion</h3>
        <p>"Motion" was the first channel I wanted to explore.
            I propose two different approaches to render the uncertainty through this channel.
            In the first example, dots move around their average position. The amplitude of the oscillation depends on the level
            of uncertainty bound to the data point. The higher is the uncertainty, the higher is the amplitude of the oscillation.
            Moreover, the size of the dots decreases when the oscillation reaches the endpoints.
            <a href="http://gioconte.github.io/MVV/mvv1.html"> MVV1</a><br></p>
        <p>
            In the second example, dots still move around their average position, but the amplitude of the oscillations is constant.
            In this case the uncertainty is represented by varying the frequency of the oscillation itself. The higher is the
            uncertainty of the data point, the faster is its oscillation. More in details the position of each data point is
            computed as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>
                frequency = 1/ (1 - uncertainty ) exp (3)
            </li>
            <li>
                y = y.origin + 3 sin ( frequency * t )
            </li>
        </ul>
        where "y.origin" is the original position of the data point.

        <h3>
            <a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Color</h3>

        <p>"Color" was the second channel I exploited. In the first example I use a linear scale (<a href="http://gioconte.github.io/MVV/mvv3.html"> MVV3</a>),
            while in the second I use a quantile scale (<a href="http://gioconte.github.io/MVV/mvv4.html"> MVV4</a>)</p>

        <h3>
            <a id="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Shape</h3>

        <p>In the following example, I exploited the shape of the data point to represent uncertainty. Each data point is represented using a circle
        and an external border. The more distant is the external border, the more uncertain the data point is. <a href="http://gioconte.github.io/MVV/mvv5.html"> MVV5</a></p>

        <h3>
            <a id="motion+shape" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Motion and Shape</h3>

        <p>In <a href="http://gioconte.github.io/MVV/mvv6.html"> MVV6</a> a combination of motion and shape is presented.
            The initial circles are stretched according the uncertainty of the data point plotted. The more stretched is the
            the data point, the more it is uncertain.
